# Summary

I am interested in computers, and human-computer interaction. That's why my interests are abstractions over the hardware: programming languages, translation techniques, and operating systems. I am also interested in working environment design.

I do systems programming, which I can define as an effort, that software end-user doesn't know about. I love to design tools, that other people may use to program.

I can describe myself as a digital minimalist, and I am a fan of N. Wirth's works and creations.

I was lucky to work in the same team where he worked, under the supervision of his colleague, prof. J. Gutknecht, the other author of the Oberon system. There, while working at Native Systems Group, Institute of Computer Systems, ETH Zurich, I have ported N. Wirth's new Oberon-07 compiler to x86/Linux.  
Later I founded a libre software project, Vishap Oberon Compiler, which became well known in the community.  

I am very interested in modern approaches in programming language and operating systems design, that are unfortunately not well known outside of academic walls. That's an Oberon family of object-oriented modular systems and also inspired of them Plan9 and Inferno.
Being deeply interested, and having some understanding of existing problems and challenges, I also have my ideas on how to extend existing systems.

I value minimalistic design because complicating the design leads to inconsistencies and future problems, and I think too often we are busy solving problems that we have created. Also, more links in the chain - more possibility that something will fail - less safety.

Here I would add that I'd think a lot before adding a feature - once you add it, it's very hard to get rid of it. When I do a design decision, and I don't see a good enough solution - I believe no solution is better than a bad solution, otherwise, later development on top of a bad solution will be very hard or impossible to roll back.

Bad design solutions lead to software that is easier to compromise. One of my major interests is techniques to increase software safety and security.

The approaches I described above would not be celebrated in industry work, where the goal is often to add more features, be fast and early on the market.

I advocate decentralized communication, I believe that the Internet is more than an access channel to a couple of big service providers. That is why I also host and maintain several nodes of decentralized 'social' networks for local communities.
